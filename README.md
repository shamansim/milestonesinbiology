# Milestones articles in biology &amp; medecine
Gathering the milestones publications in biology &amp; medecine

Here I would like to gather the publications that leads to our actual knowledge, paradigms and technology in biology and medecine. The format is not fixed yet, but it should include the date, a category tag, a quick title of the improvement and the direct links to the journal page of the article (http and doi link).
